                        Adorned with a dazzling,
                        complex system of icy rings, 
                        Saturn is unique in our solar system. 
                        The other giant planets have rings, 
                        but none are as spectacular as Saturn's.

                    The fifth largest moon in the 
                    solar system,
                    Earth's moon is the only place
                    beyond Earth where humans
                    have set foot.

                    Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world
                    with a very thin atmosphere. 
                    There is strong evidence Mars was
                    billions of years ago wetter and warmer,
                    with a thicker atmosphere.

                    Pluto is a complex world of ice
                    mountains and frozen plains. 
                    Once considered the ninth planet,
                    Pluto is the best known of a 
                    new class of worlds called dwarf planets.

                    Earth—our home planet—is the only place
                     we know of so far that’s inhabited by 
                     living things. It's also the only 
                     planet in our solar system with 
                     liquid water on the surface.
